# Linear-models

Implementing Linear models from the ground up in C++ by using my Linear Algebra Framework as a starting point

-  Multiple Linear Regression :
      - Implemented using Normal Equations
      - Gradient Descent (To be Done)
      
-  Logistic Regression : 
      - Implemented using Gradient Ascent
      

To switch models modify the main.cpp file .
