# Linear-models

Implementing Linear models from the ground up in C++ by using my Linear Algebra Framework as a starting point

-  Multiple Linear Regression :
      1. Implemented using Normal Equations (but they were unstable for large datasets when computing inverse)
      2. QR Decomposition
 
-  Logistic Regression
