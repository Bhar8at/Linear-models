# Linear-models

Implementing Linear models from the ground up in C++ by using my Linear Algebra Framework as a starting point

-  Multiple Linear Regression (To run do ./MLR.sh):
      - Implemented using Normal Equations
      - Gradient Descent (To be Done)
      
-  Logistic Regression (To run do ./LR.sh):
